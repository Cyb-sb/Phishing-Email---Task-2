Task 2: Analyze a Phishing Email Sample

Objective:
Identify phishing characteristics in a suspicious email sample and summarize them in a report format.

Tools Used:
- Email sample (screenshot)
- Basic email analysis techniques (domain check, tone, hyperlink inspection)
- Manual analysis (header tools not used due to image-based sample)

Sample Email Analyzed:

1. Subject: Response Required  
2. Sender Email: service.paypai@outlook.com  
3. Date of Email: Not specified (visible in screenshot)  
4. Brand Targeted: PayPal  
5. Screenshot Used:  



Indicators of Phishing Identified

1. Spoofed Email Address
- The sender’s email is "service.paypai@outlook.com" — looks like “PayPal” but is clearly fake.
- Uses the domain "@outlook.com", which PayPal does not use for service communication.
- This is a classic spoofing technique to trick users at first glance.

2. Urgent or Threatening Language
- The email pressures the recipient with statements like:
  - "Your account is still temporarily limited..."
  - "Check that no one has logged in without your permission..."
- Such fear-based language is used to force quick reactions without thinking.

3. Deceptive Hyperlinks
- Texts like “log in” and “Resolution Center” are hyperlinked.
- Likely point to "fake PayPal login pages" that steal credentials.


4. Lack of Personalization
- Uses a generic greeting: "Dear"
- Legitimate companies (especially PayPal) usually address customers by name.
- Indicates mass phishing campaign.

5. Suspicious Grammar and Tone
- Informal and inconsistent wording such as:  
  - “We emailed you a little while ago...”
  - Lacks professional tone typical of verified PayPal emails.
- Several sentences sound "unrefined and robotic".

6. Misuse of Branding
- The email mimics PayPal’s logo and styling.
- However, layout and structure are overly simple and lack standard PayPal security elements.



Summary of Findings:

Indicator - Observation 

1. Spoofed Email - Fake domain ('paypai@outlook.com') .
2. Urgency & Fear - Claims account limitation & unauthorized login. 
3. Link Manipulation - Hyperlinks masked behind login & resolution text. 
4. No Personalization - Uses “Dear” instead of recipient's name.
5. Grammar Issues - Casual language and unprofessional tone.
6. Branding Tricks - Uses PayPal logo but lacks official structure.



Outcome:
Through this analysis, I’ve developed awareness of phishing tactics including:
- Spotting fake sender domains
- Identifying urgency or emotional manipulation
- Verifying hyperlink legitimacy
- Recognizing mass mail indicators and branding tricks

This task helped reinforce "email threat analysis skills" and critical thinking about social engineering tactics.



Learnings Applied:
- Phishing email dissection
- Awareness of email spoofing and fake domain tactics
- Recognizing psychological manipulation in scam attempts
